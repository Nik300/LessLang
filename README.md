# LessLang 0.2
## Project State
The project is in an early stage and is not ready for practical usage.
### What's ready
#### Runtime
The runtime is almost ready. Objects and types work as expected, operators work and objects can be invoked as well.<br/>
In the runtime is also present a Garbage Collector. I also expect to implement a cache for objects, in order to ease the weight on both processor and RAM.<br/>
Math expressions are addressed in the Statement Parser.
#### Statement Parser
The statement parser is currently undergoing thinking process and is being structured.<br/>
It will support variable, function and type declarations as well as math expressions and operations between constants.
### Division
The project is divided into three main sections: <br/>
Section          | Working Status
---------------- | --------------------
Runtime          | üìç Milestone 2
Statement Parser | ‚öíÔ∏è Work in Progress
Parser           | ‚åö Planned

## How to build
### Unix systems (Linux/macOS)
This is currently the only options to try out the runtime.<br/>
First install these dependencies:<br/>
Dependency         | Required | Link
------------------ | -------- | -----------------------------------------------
build-essentials   | YES      |
gcc, g++ compilers | YES      |
VS Code            | NO       | [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
make               | YES      |
git                | NO       |

Next, build one of the tests as follows:
`make tests/<test name>` <br/>
For instance, consider the test named "union" under tests/union.cpp, I'd run it like this:
`make tests/union`
and that's it <br/>
## Code Samples
Here are some code samples I've been desingin for a while now:
### Hello World!
```typescript
message: string = "Hello, World!";
main(args: [string]): void {
  sys.println("message:", message);
}
```
The output to this code should be: <br/>
`message: Hello, World!`
### Module
#### import
```typescript
-> console;
main(args: [string]): void {
  console.writeln("Hello!");
}
```
The `->` symbol works as an `import` keyword
#### export
```typescript
<- test;
^fn(): string {
  return "Hello!";
}
^variable: Const<integer> = 5;
```
The symbol `<-` is used to declare the export name of a certain module.<br/>
The prefix `^` exports the related object.
